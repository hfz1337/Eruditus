## About
Eruditus is a Discord CTF helper bot built with Python, it was initially designed to be
used internally within the CyberErudites CTF team in order to make team work as efficient
as possible.  
The bot implements a bunch of useful features and uses **Discord's Slash commands** to
make its usage as intuitive as possible.

## Features
### Core functionalities
- Manage channels and their permissions
- Create Discord scheduled events for upocoming CTF competitions
- Track CTFs progress
- Track members' participation in challenges
- Announcements upon solving a challenge
- Flag submission from within the Discord guild

and more.

### Miscellaneous
- Provides a utility to lookup system calls from a specific architecture
- Provides a utility for basic encoding schemes
- Provides a utility for classic ciphers

### Supported platforms
As you already read this bot can interact with the CTF platforms, meaning that you can:
- Submit your flags within the bot
- Observe the leaderboard
- Automatically parse challenges from the platform
- Automatically create team accounts on the platform (or use already existing ones)
- And many more

Currently, Eruditus supports these platforms:
- CTFd
- rCTF
